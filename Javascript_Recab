Start in browser console.log("Hello World");
- what is console.log(), and why we can run JS in browser inspect tab? ES6 enviroment in general. 

Moving to NPM, we will aquire the JS running enviroment locally. is it installed?
- quick intro to NPM what capability it provides, why do we need it? what its alternative in other programming languages that they know?
- let's list the commands that we will frequently need and keep it for later.

what shell we need to run the code? I used to have issue with that. depends on the machine as well

create workspace(folder) for the JS starter project, and open it in visual studio code. 
create index.js file, and write the same console.log() message in it. 
Run the code. 
Notice the node_modules, why we need done modules. package json also.
commands we can add in packag.json .

next: 
variables
if-else
functions, let's pick multiple syntaxes for functions. 
classess
create instance from the class
constrcutors 
functions inside classes. 

Additional: let's check a library in NPM website and download it. How to search, how to use? 
additional: chatgpt.
